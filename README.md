# reactReduxBankApp

Welcome to a simple banking web app where users can deposit + withdraw transactions.

## Running the project locally
- Clone the repo
- Run npm install
- Run npm start. 

## Testing
- To test, run npm test.

## Built using:
- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Semantic UI
- Jest

## For improvements
- Add more integration/interaction tests to better cover all cases.
- Extract action types/names into a constant to avoid any human typing errors.
- It was perhaps unnecessary to use state to control the two modal views. Could have just let react router handle it.
- Set up Express server instead of using webpack dev server.
